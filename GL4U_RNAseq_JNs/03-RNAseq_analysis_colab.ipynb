Below are step-by-step instructions for analyzing count data from samples derived from the soleus (aka \"anti-gravity\") muscle of mice that were either flown in space aboard the International Space Station (ISS) (spaceflight, FLT) or kept in an environmental simulator on Earth to serve as ground control (GC) animals during NASA's Rodent Research - 1 mission. We will start our analysis with the OSD-104 RSEM gene count data that we generated using the [RNAseq processing JN, part 2](02-RNAseq_processing_2of2_colab.ipynb). More information about the samples analyzed here can be found in the [Open Science Data Repository](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo) under [OSD-104](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-104).**  \n",

However, since there are a small number of replicates per group (6 in our dataset), the estimates of variation for each gene are often unreliable, especially for genes with smaller means (due to the large differences in dispersion for lower expressing genes). To address this issue, DESeq2 _shares information across genes_ to generate more accurate estimates of variation based on the mean expression level of the gene.\n",
